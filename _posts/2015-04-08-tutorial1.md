### Logistics

#### Setup (please do before the tutorial if possible)

In preparation for the tutorial, it would be great if you could install the following on your computer:
 
- [Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) 
- [git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [gradle](https://gradle.org/)
 
If you encounter problems, feel free to come by at the office hour (4pm), or to post the issue on Piazza.

#### References on java

- [Learning the Java Language](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html) (you can skip the following topics on first reading: nested classes, annotations, generics) 
- [Collections](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/index.html) (you can skip the following topics on first reading: Aggregate Operations, custom implementation, Interoperability)
- [Notes from last year](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/courses/stat547-sp2013-14/lab/2014/01/15/lab2.html)

But be assured that we are there to answer any questions you may have!

#### Setup at the beginning of the tutorial

At the beginning of the tutorial, you will able to clone the repository [simplesmc-scaffold](https://github.com/alexandrebouchard/simplesmc-scaffold) using 
 ``git clone git@github.com:alexandrebouchard/simplesmc-scaffold.git``. 
 
Then, follow these steps:
 
- Type ``gradle eclipse`` from the root of the repository
- From eclipse:
   - ``Import`` in ``File`` menu
   - ``Import existing projects into workspace``
   - Select the root
   - Deselect ``Copy projects into workspace`` to avoid having duplicates
   
### High performance posterior inference with SMC

We will cover a prefix of the following (another lab can be organized to cover the rest if there is interest):

- Efficient resampling
- Modular design of proposal distribributions
- Parallel and correct SMC implementation
- PMCMC

The first step is in ``src/test/java/simplesmc/resampling/TestPopulationResampling.java``. Look in this file for more instructions.

The following steps will be posted shortly (and may require a pull for additional scaffold files).
